# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a Node.js application that provides a simple interface for users to access and download PDF documents. It utilizes popular libraries like Express for web server capabilities, EJS as a templating engine, and various middleware for security and session management. This application is designed to be a lightweight, secure platform for distributing documents within a controlled environment.
